# Neural-network-from-scratch

> “What I cannot create, I do not understand” - Richard Feynman.

This repository contains mini python scripts which will strictly not use any deep learning libraries, but will implement, neural networks from it's core. 
- This will be done first using arrays and manual dot product.
- Transitioning to using NumPy (because it makes matrix multiplication so much easier).
- Writing loss functions and activation functions using their core math principles and so on.

## Optimization

- What is Random optimization? Tweaking the weights and biases by a small number, measuring loss and keeping the best weights and biases over many iterations. This technique works for simple vertical data but does not work well when the problem is more complex, i.e fitting spiral data.
